        question: 'How do I prepare for engineering mathematics and general aptitude for the GATE 2023?',
        excerpt: 'There is plethora of material out there which you can use for preparing engineering mathematics and reasoning and aptitude. See this section alone is worth 30% and is extremely important portion if you want to be in top 500 ranks.',
        readmore: `I guess you would have already attempted previous year questions. Apart from this you can use IES MASTER's books for practice purpose. Along with that get topper's handwritten notes. These are now-a-days easily available online at websites like HINDUSTANPHOTOSTAT (.in). They will have shortcuts and better approaches which will help you increase speeds and attempts hence resulting in better score. And towards the end you may give subjective test series. This will help you evaluate your prepation wrt to others. You can easily find them in the test series packages of big coachings.\n\nI guess this would more than enough. Do this much seriously to become capable of any sort of question appearing infront of you.`,

Research thoroughly on the topic before attempting to write.\n\n❯ Format : Learn the format of writing articles, letters, essays, stories.\n\n❯ Avoid grammatical mistakes : Grammatical mistakes in any piece of writing is a big turn off for the readers. Pay attention to the tense, commas, semicolons, spellings etc.\n\n❯ Maintain the flow : Try to write in a way you speak. Writing, is a mode of conversing your ideas or thoughts to others.

        question: 'What is Quantum Mechanics in simple language?',
        excerpt: 'Quantum mechanics represents the realization that when it comes to atoms and elementary particles, Nature does not work as we would naively expect.',
        readmore: `This realization grew out of the observation of many curious properties of atoms, not the least of which is that when an atom absorbs or emits energy, it always happens in well-defined units, or “quanta”, which are specific to each type of atom.\n\nUltimately we understood that these phenomena happen because of the way physical systems with few “degrees of freedom” work. Each “degree of freedom” characterizes the way in which something can move, rotate, vibrate, etc. For instance, a free elementary particle has three degrees of freedom: It can move in the three spatial directions. But since it has no internal parts or shape, it cannot vibrate or rotate, so no additional degrees of freedom are present.\n\nContrary to our naive expectations, systems with few degrees of freedom do not have well-defined positions and velocities in the classical sense. Rather, their state is usually defined as a multitude of possible positions and a multitude of possible velocities, mixed together in a superposition.\n\nSomething classical (such as a measuring instrument), in turn, would be made of a huge number of atoms, thus represented by a very large number of individual degrees of freedom. All that superposition weirdness gets averaged away for such classical things, and we end up with our usual perception of the world, in which baseballs, cannonballs, people, cats, etc., all have well-defined trajectories and velocities. \n\nElementary particles (with few degrees of freedom) only have such well-defined positions or velocities (but never both!) when they interact with a classical system, which temporarily confines the particle to an eigenstate: an ugly but useful compound noun combining the German word eigen (meaning “own” or “inherent”) with an English word.`,

        question: 'What personality disorders are common in children of narcisstic parents?',
        excerpt: 'I honestly want to answer this without going Anonymous, but I guess I have to pass with this for the time being. My Dad seems to be a narcissist. More like an insecure narcissist. And my Mom seems to be affected by this behaviour of my Dad and she always feels that she cannot do anything on her own.',
        readmore: "Let me give an objective analysis of both the traits of the parents and the children concerned.\n\n➨ Narcissist Parents:\n\nThey cannot accept criticism. No debate, no argument. You do it because I say so. This is their general attitude. The most annoying part about this is not that they act so. It is that they put up a totally different appearance in public. Hence, no one gets to know a thing about reality.\n\nConstant temper outbursts. Yes, this is a serious problem with my Dad. Initially I felt that may be I was exaggerating these things and I had to just ignore them. Instead of making a judgement, I decided to count the number of times he got angry. It was a staggering 8 times in a mere fortnight. And by getting angry, I do not count trivial stuff like yelling out for me to be bringing something. 3 of them were personal attacks to make me feel worthless. Other 5 were for random stuff.\n\nThey make your choices. This is a major problem. In fact I realized this a long time ago. For example, they forced me to not play with my friends for a trivial stuff. The story goes like this. \n\nMy friends and I used to play cricket almost every day(back when I was 11 years old). Since we played on streets and random fields, most of the times, it so happens that each one of us had to bring a tennis ball to play in turns. It was a logical and healthy agreement. One fine day, my turn came. I explained this to my Dad. His solution: Stop playing. Why should you be buying stuff? Honestly, for once all he had to do was to buy me a tennis ball which hardly costs 30 rupees. Instead from that day onwards I was forced to not speak to my friends. My dad used to scold me daily for speaking to them. This was the sort of emotional abuse I was subjected to. Since then, I have never made any friends till I entered college.\n\n➨ Let me elaborate on my traits now.\n\nI have a host of mental disorders which I cannot discuss with anyone. For the outside world, we are a happy family. For me, my home is total bonkers. I do not know whether I am going to be totally screwed for no reason at all. I am an introvert, have serious trouble striking conversations.But I somehow managed to hone my English skills by participating in various debate competitions. Also, my dad views all my extra curricular achievements with disgust.\n\nEdit: As I am not able to comment anonymously, I guess I have to communicate via this answer itself. Thanks for the people who can understand this and have upvoted this. (I do not mind if you upvote or not. It is more than enough if you had the patience to read through this and empathize.)",
